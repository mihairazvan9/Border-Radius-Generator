# Border-Radius-Generator
Create extraordinary borders, because it's much easier to create them visually. Modify the CSS properties with JavaScript.

The Technologies Used:
    CSS
    JavaScript    

CSS
  -I used CSS to stylize the elements created in HTML
  -in the :root CSS pseudo-class I declared global CSS variables:
  -I set the property "border-radius" and as parameters I wrote variables from :root
 
 JavaScript
  -the HTML DOM allows JavaScript to change the style of HTML elements
  -I used basic JavaScript method, like a "getElementById", "setProperty" to create custom functions 
with which I can change the variables in CSS
